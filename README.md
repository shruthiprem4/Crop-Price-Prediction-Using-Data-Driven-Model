# Crop-Price-Prediction-Using-Data-Driven-Model
Data-driven crop price prediction system using ARIMA, SARIMA, Auto-ARIMA, LSTM, and Hybrid ( ARIMA–LSTM ) models, featuring automatic model comparison and a Flask-based interactive web interface for real-time forecasts

Project Showcase: Crop Price Prediction using Time Series Forecasting 🌾📈

Excited to share my project that predicts future crop prices by analyzing historical agricultural data using advanced time series and deep learning models.

🧠 Models Implemented:
ARIMA | SARIMA | Auto-ARIMA | LSTM | Hybrid (ARIMA–LSTM)

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Python | Flask | TensorFlow | Pandas | Statsmodels | Matplotlib

💡 Key Highlights:

Forecasts crop prices on a weekly or monthly basis

Uses five different models, compares their performance using metrics like MAPE, and displays the best-performing model’s prediction

Interactive Flask-based web app for user inputs (crop, state, duration)

Hybrid ARIMA–LSTM model enhances accuracy by combining linear and nonlinear learning

This project integrates AI with Agriculture to deliver precise, data-driven insights — empowering farmers, traders, and policymakers to make smarter market decisions🌱
